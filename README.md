## Election Audit Summary
The script used to analyze this local election can be easily modified for future use. In order to better understand election results, we can add modifiers which tabulate different demographic features (ie. age, income, education, ethnicity, etc.). Likewise, votes can be further broken down to assess the county and percentage of votes each candidate recieved per county and per city within each county. Looking at demographic as well as regional trends can help future candidates develop smarter, more efficient campaign strategies and also provide election committees insight into possible changes in voter turnout.
